- I'm programming with VSCode & PlatformIO (PIO). You could use the Arduino IDE, but the serial monitor kinda sucks and swapping between boards and ports isn't great. Future proofing stuff and myself by forcing myself to do it the correct way now.

TODO: 
- Write scripts for testing
- Implement PN532 Drivers (the correct way)
(?) - Implement FreeRTOS and scheduler
(?) - Implement drivers for BMI270
(?) - Add other stuff into this repo if it'll be used
